    "# Introduction to JupyterHub\n",
    "*Written by Jeremy Huckins & Luke Chang*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will primarily be using python to learn about fMRI data analysis. Many of the laboratories can be run on your own individual laptops once you have installed Python (preferably via an [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Often we will also be working with neuroimaging datasets, which can have large storage requirements. We will also occasionally be using additional software that will be called by Python (e.g., preprocessing). Finally, some of the analyses we will run can be very computationally expensive and may exceed the capabilities of your laptop.  To meet these needs, Dartmouth's Research Computing has generously provided an AWS cloud server that will allow us to store data, access specialized software, and run analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main portal to access this resource will be through the Jupyterhub interface. This allows you to remotely login in to the server through your browser at [jhub.dartmouth.edu](https://jhub.dartmouth.edu) using your netid. Please let us know if you are having difficulty logging in as this might mean we need to have an account created for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of quick notes.  To be a good user, please do not leave your notebook running when you aren't using it. This can be accomplished by using the *logout* button when you're done rather than simply closing your laptop or browser. Additionally we will try to clean up intermediate data files that we are not using at the end of each lab."

    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a great way to have your code, comments and results show up inline in a web browser. Work for this class will be done in Jupyter notebooks so you can reference what you have done, see the results and someone else could redo it in the future, similar to a typical lab notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than writing and re-writing an entire program, you can write lines of code and run them one at a time. Then, if you need to make a change, you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again, all in the same window. In our specific case, we are going to use [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which lets several people access the same computer and data at the same time through a web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can view examples and share your work with the world very easily through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org).  One easy trick if you use a cloud storage service like dropbox is to paste a link to the dropbox file in nbviewer.  These links will persist as long as the file remains being shared via dropbox."
